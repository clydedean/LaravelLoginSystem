⚠️ Important Dev Notes from Deancv

FIREBASE SMS IS PAID AND CANT BE USED HERE, INSTEAD IM USING AN EMAIL VERIFICATION.
Firebase does NOT support "Email OTP" (sending a 123456 code to email) natively.

To achieve "2FA for every login" using Firebase's free tier is actually the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) feature (like Google Authenticator), but that requires an app.

Recommended Workaround (The "Magic Link" flow) will be implemented.
