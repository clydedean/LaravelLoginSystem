⚠️ Important Dev Notes from Dean

1. Limited Real SMS (10/day)

Firebase's "Spark Plan" (Free Tier) has a strict limit on real SMS messages to prevent abuse.

Limit: Approximately 10 SMS messages per day.

Error: If you exceed this, you will see an error: quota-exceeded.

Solution: For development testing, ALWAYS use Test Phone Numbers (see below).

2. Im not using Real SMS for Testing!!! So its limited.
